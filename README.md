# Great Walks Quiz

This short quiz helps users choose which of New's Zealands Great Walks is best for them. The subject matter is not as important as the format, which is very similar to a recent client project that recommended products to online shoppers. This version uses a simple algorithm for selecting the result whereas the client solution connected to a backend. Similarly, the quiz data is loaded via JSON instead of a database collection. That said, my intention is to highlight a front end similar to what I have done for client work in the past.
